# Problem Statement

## In the field of talent sourcing and management, understanding the unique requirements of each role and identifying the right candidates who meet these criteria remains a complex challenge. Given the intricacies involved in understanding client requirements, discerning candidate suitability, and locating a large number of potential candidates, current semi-automated processes demands significant manual labor. To enhance efficiency, a machine learning-powered pipeline will be established, capable of spotting and ranking candidates based on their fit for specific roles. While keyword-based searches, such as “full-stack software engineer” or “aspiring human resources,” to source candidates, the aim is to introduce a dynamic ranking system. This system will incorporate warning signals for supervisory approval for occasional manual reviews, allowing for real-time re-ranking of candidate lists whenever a candidate is identified and starred as the ideal match. The objective is to streamline the candidate shortlisting process, reduce manual intervention, and continuously improve the accuracy of our automated rankings based on human feedback.
